# database_project

Project Speciifcations:
This project will require you to design and implement your own database based on the following requirements:

A minimum of 6 relational tables
Appropriate implicit constraints (including primary & foreign keys)
Explicit (semantic) constraints such as table constraint(s) and triggers (you need not implement assertions)
At least one view should also be defined within the database
A minimum of 5 tuples per table

You are required to implement the database using MySQL.
To complete this task, use whatever software you find most appropriate to design your functional dependency diagram and to write your report.
